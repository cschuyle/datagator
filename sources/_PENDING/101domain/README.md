1.  `brew install csvkit`

1.  Log in to <https://101domain.com>.

1.  In the My Domains page (https://my.101domain.com/dashboard / View All Domains), choose Export Domains Summary or Export Extended Domain Info (the latter is a superset).

1.  This should download a file called `domains.csv`.
    Save that file in this directory.

1.  `transform.sh` will do the rest on the pipeline.
    So, push!

**Note** that <https://101domain.com> and <https://nic.sh> are the same site.
