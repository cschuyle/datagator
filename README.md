# Datagator

**To Keep Your Data Safe**

Datagator is for collecting your data from The Internet. 

It's a collection of scripts to extract and transform data from a number of websites, and make it searchable.

## Command line

The `dg` command searches your "troves" (each source of data is called a trove).

There's also a upcoming repo: A web site to navigate your troves. It's yet to be made public.
