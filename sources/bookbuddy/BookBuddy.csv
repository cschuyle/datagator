A Middle English Reader,,,,,"Kenneth Sisam,J. R. R. Tolkien","Sisam, Kenneth",,,,,,Courier Corporation,,2005/01/01,2005,,,,Language Arts & Disciplines,"Scholarly and highly informative, this anthology represents a distinctive contribution to the understanding and enjoyment of Middle English literature. Kenneth Sisam's well-chosen extracts from writings of the 14th century illustrate a rising new spirit in vernacular works. Selections include excerpts from such tales as Sir Gawayne and the Grene Knight and the Gest Hystoriale of the destruction of Troy, the immortal Piers Plowman, John Wycliffe's translation of the Bible, political commentaries, and poetry. In addition to notes on each selection and an informative appendix, this volume features an extensive glossary by J. R. R. Tolkien. Best known as the author of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien was an Oxford University professor of linguistics whose ""vocabulary"" offers an effective and practical complement to this outstanding anthology.",,,,,,,,,,,450,,,,,,English,,,,,,9780486440231,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/06/17 13:13:18.284476041,,,,,,,,X78hLLg6__8C,,0,0,0,,,

Ergativity,,,,,Robert M. W. Dixon,"Dixon, Robert M. W.",,,,,,Cambridge University Press,,1994/06/02,1994,,,,Language Arts & Disciplines,"Although there is only one ergative language in Europe (Basque), perhaps one-quarter of the world's languages show ergative properties, and pose considerable difficulties for many current linguistic theories. R. M. W. Dixon here provides a full survey of the various types of ergativity, looking at the ways they interrelate, their semantic bases and their role in the organisation of discourse. Ergativity stems from R. M. W. Dixon's long-standing interest in the topic, and in particular from his seminal 1979 paper in Language. It includes a rich collection of data from a large number of the world's languages. Comprehensive, clear and insightful, it will be the standard point of reference for all those interested in the topic.",,,,,,,,,,,271,,,,,,English,,,,,,9780521448987,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/06/16 18:24:17.109205961,,,,,,,,fKfSAu6v5LYC,,0,0,0,,,
Europe,,A History,,,Norman Davies,"Davies, Norman",,,,,,Harper Collins,,1998/01/20,1998,,,,History,"Here is a masterpiece of historical narrative that stretches from the Ice Age to the Atomic Age, as it tells the story of Europe, East and West. Norman Davies captures it all-the rise and fall of Rome, the sweeping invasions of Alaric and Atilla, the Norman Conquests, the Papal struggles for power, the Renaissance and the Reformation, the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, Europe's rise to become the powerhouse of the world, and its eclipse in our own century, following two devastating World Wars. This is the first major history of Europe to give equal weight to both East and West, and it shines light on fascinating minority communities, from heretics and lepers to Gypsies, Jews, and Muslims. It also takes an innovative approach, combining traditional narrative with unique features that help bring history alive: 299 time capsules scattered through the narrative capture telling aspects of an era. 12 -snapshots offer a panoramic look at all of Europe at a particular moment in history. Full coverage of Eastern Europe—100 maps and diagrams, 72 black-and-white plates.All told, Davies’'s Europe represents one of the most important and illuminating histories to be published in recent years.",,,,,,,,,,,1392,,,,,,English,,,,,,9780060974688,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/06/07 12:46:01.866980075,,,,,,,,4StZDvPCcJEC,,0,0,0,,,

Applicable everywhere from the boardroom to the bedroom, from the playing field to the battlefield, its wisdom has never been more highly regarded. Now available in its complete form, including the Chinese characters and English text, this essential examination of the art of decisive military strategy features extensive commentary and an insightful historical introduction written by Lionel Giles, its original translator.

The Balancing Act,,Combining Symbolic and Statistical Approaches to Language,,,"Judith L. Klavans,Philip Resnik","Klavans, Judith L.",,,,,,MIT Press,,,1996,,,,Language Arts & Disciplines,"Symbolic and statistical approaches to language have historically been at odds - the former viewed as difficult to test and therefore perhaps impossible to define, and the latter as descriptive but possibly inadequate. At the heart of the debate are fundamental questions concerning the nature of language, the role of data in building a model or theory, and the impact of the competence-performance distinction on the field of computational linguistics. There is an increasing realization in both camps that the two approaches have something to offer in achieving common goals.",,,,,,,,,,,186,,,,,,English,,,,,,9780262112185,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/06/07 13:32:29.029863834,,,,,,,,-n2jQgAACAAJ,,0,0,0,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9512011-L.jpg,
Vanished Kingdoms,,The History of Half-Forgotten Europe,,,Norman Davies,"Davies, Norman",,,,,,Penguin Books Limited,,2011/10/27,2011,,,,History,"'Norman Davies has the gift of all great historians - the ability to make us rethink the past' The Times 'The past is a foreign country' has become a truism, yet we often forget that the past is different from the present in many unfamiliar ways, and historical memory is extraordinarily imperfect. We habitually think of the European past as the history of countries which exist today - France, Germany, Britain, Russia and so on - but often this actually obstructs our view of the past, and blunts our sensitivity to the ever-changing political landscape. Europe's history is littered with kingdoms, duchies, empires and republics which have now disappeared but which were once fixtures on the map of their age - 'the Empire of Aragon' which once dominated the western Mediterranean; the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, for a time the largest country in Europe; the successive kingdoms (and one duchy) of Prussia, much of whose history is now half-remembered at best. This book shows the reader how to peer through the cracks of mainstream history writing and listen to the echoes of lost realms across the centuries. How many British people know that Glasgow was founded by the Welsh in a period when neither England nor Scotland existed? How many of us will remember the former Soviet Union in a few generations' time? Will our own United Kingdom become a distant memory too? As in his earlier celebrated booksEurope- aAhistoryand The Isles, Norman Davies aims to subvert our established view of what seems familiar, and urges us to look and think again. This stimulating surprising book, full of unexpected stories, observations and connections, gives us a fresh and original perspective on the history of Europe.",,,,,,,,,,,830,,,,,,English,,,,,,9781846143380,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/06/07 12:46:01.882300853,,,,,,,,S-kwH8MnxlkC,,0,0,0,,,
"Your Code As a Crime Scene, Second Edition",,"Use Forensic Techniques to Arrest Defects, Bottlenecks, and Bad Design in Your Programs",,,Adam Tornhill,"Tornhill, Adam",,,,,,“The” Pragmatic Bookshelf,,,2024,,,,Computers,"Jack the Ripper and legacy codebases have more in common than you'd think. Inspired by forensic psychology methods, you can apply strategies to identify problems in your existing code, assess refactoring direction, and understand how your team influences the software architecture. With its unique blend of criminal psychology and code analysis, Your Code as a Crime Scene arms you with the techniques you need to take on any codebase, no matter what programming language you use. Software development might well be the most challenging task humanity ever attempted. As systems scale up, they also become increasingly complex, expensive to maintain, and difficult to reason about. We can always write more tests, try to refactor, and even fire up a debugger to understand complex coding constructs. That's a great starting point, but you can do so much better. Take inspiration from forensic psychology techniques to understand and improve existing code. Visualize codebases via a geographic profile from commit data to find development hotspots, prioritize technical debt, and uncover hidden dependencies. Get data and develop strategies to make the business case for larger refactorings. Detect and fix organizational problems from the vantage point of the software architecture to remove bottlenecks for the teams. The original Your Code as a Crime Scene from 2014 pioneered techniques for understanding the intersection of people and code. This new edition reflects a decade of additional experience from hundreds of projects. Updated techniques, novel case studies, and extensive new material adds to the strengths of this cult classic. Change how you view software development and join the hunt for better code! What You Need:  You need to be comfortable reading code. You also need to use Git (or Subversion, Mercurial or similar version-control tool).",,,,,,,,,,,336,,,,,,English,,,,,,9798888650325,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/06/16 17:46:29.848109960,,,,,,,,nEtx0AEACAAJ,,0,0,0,,,
